                <p>Maldives is a tropical paradise known for its crystal-clear waters, white sandy beaches, and vibrant coral reefs. However, this idyllic destination is facing significant threats from climate change and rising sea levels. Let's explore the causes, effects, and solutions to protect the Maldives' fragile ecosystem.</p>

                <h3>Cause</h3>
                <p>Climate change leads to rising sea temperatures, causing coral bleaching. Ocean acidification, driven by increased carbon dioxide (CO₂), further weakens coral structures.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card effect-card">
                <h3>Effect</h3>
                <p>Large-scale coral bleaching has led to over 90% coral mortality in some areas. The loss of biodiversity and the deterioration of marine ecosystems impact tourism and local economies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card solution-card">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Reducing global carbon emissions is critical. Scientists are also working on coral restoration and conservation efforts to limit pollution and overfishing.</p>

                <h3>Why Does It Matter?</h3>
                <p>The Maldives faces severe threats from rising sea levels caused by global warming. As glaciers melt and ocean temperatures rise, seawater expands, leading to higher sea levels. Since the Maldives is made up of low-lying islands, many of which are just a few meters above sea level, it is particularly vulnerable to these changes. The rising sea levels pose an existential threat to this island nation, endangering its very existence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card impact-card">
                <h3>Consequences of Rising Sea Levels</h3>
                <p>Coastal erosion is shrinking the islands and destroying natural habitats. Saltwater intrusion is contaminating freshwater supplies, complicating agriculture and access to drinking water. Frequent flooding and storm surges are damaging infrastructure and rendering parts of the islands uninhabitable. There is a real risk of the entire country becoming submerged, leading to the displacement of residents and creating climate refugees.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card solution-card">
                <h3>What Can Be Done?</h3>
                <p>Global efforts to reduce carbon emissions are crucial to slow the rate of sea-level rise and global warming. The Maldivian government is investing in coastal protection measures, such as sea walls and artificial islands, to safeguard against rising waters. International cooperation and climate agreements, such as the Paris Accord, are essential to ensure countries take action to protect vulnerable regions like the Maldives. Rapid and coordinated global efforts are required to mitigate the existential threat faced by the Maldives.</p>
